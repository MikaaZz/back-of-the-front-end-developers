# Back of the Front-end developers:
## A definition: A back-of-the-front-end developer is a web developer who specializes in writing JavaScript code necessary to make a web application function properly.

### Their responsibilities can include:

- Writing application business logic to handle things like CRUD functionality and to control application state, routing, cache, authentication, and so on. In   short, back-of-the-front-end developers write the code necessary for the application to function properly.
- Wiring up, integrating with, and even authoring data sources, services, and APIs. This can include things like retrieving, manipulating, and displaying content from a CMS, or posting data to the appropriate service when a user submits a form.
- Consuming the UI code authored by the front-of-the-front-end developers in order to compose screens and connect real functionality data, and services.
- Optimizing the performance of JavaScript code in order to create a snappy, responsive application that fetches and fetches/posts data quickly.
- Writing end-to-end, integration, and other tests to ensure the application works as intended.
- Architecting and managing JavaScript-based infrastructure, such as Node frameworks, tools, and services.
- Managing devops stuff, such as JavaScript bundlers, deployment tooling, CI/CD stuff, and so on
- Working with front-of-the-front-end developers to ensure the UI component library contains all the components, variants, and API hooks necessary in order to build the application and all its states.
- Working with the product team to ensure all product states are accurately represented in the living, breathing application
- Working with other backend developers and IT to ensure the right technical infrastructure is in place and that the application is able to properly integrate/communicate with non-JavaScript backend code.
